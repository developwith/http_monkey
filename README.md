  # response = agent.at("http://someservice.com").
  #              with_header("Content-Type" => "application/json").
  #              basic_auth("user", "pass").
  #              get

  response = agent.at("http://google.com").get
  puts response.code  # response.headers and response.body

  # you can change settings on your client
  agent.configure do
    middlewares do
    # Default HTTP Headers (to all requests)
    use HttpMonkey::M::DefaultHeaders, {"Content-Type" => "application/json"}

    # Filter ALL requests (access to env and request objects)
    middlewares.use HttpMonkey::M::RequestFilter do |env, request|
      # HTTPI::Request, you can set proxy, timeouts, authentication etc.
      # req.proxy = "http://proxy.com"
    end

    # Enable automatic follow redirect
    middlewares.use HttpMonkey::M::FollowRedirect, :max_tries => 3
  end

  # or settings by request
  response = agent.at("http://google.com").get do
    net_adapter :curb # [:httpclient, :curb, :net_http, :em_http]
    behaviours do
      on([301, 302]) do |client, request, response|
